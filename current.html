Chemistry and Technology Prague (UCT Prague), and a PhD in cheminformatics
from the same university. His doctoral work focused on the computational
exploration of chemical space, including the development of algorithms for structure
generation. His work also extended into virtual screening and synthetic accessibility
estimation. Ivan has held research positions at the Czech Institute of Molecular
Genetics and at the Department of Informatics and Chemistry at UCT Prague, where
he has contributed to cheminformatics, forensic/data analysis and IT infrastructure
development. He has developed and deployed cheminformatic software used in drug
discovery, data analysis and forensics. In 2022, he was awarded a GoIPD
Fellowship hosted at Trinity College Dublin in collaboration with prof. Darren Fayne,
with whom he later transferred to Dublin City University as part of the Molecule
Design Group.</div>

          <div class="tab-content">Ivan has contributed to multiple research projects spanning cheminformatics,
computational drug design and chemical forensics. For his PhD, he created and
screened a million-compound virtual library of potential steroid receptor ligands. He
also developed the Feature Interrelation Profiling methodology for estimating
compound properties based on mutual information and Kullback-Leibler divergence
patterns between compound structural features in different datasets. His current
postdoc research pertains to target fishing, i.e. identifying novel biological targets for
given molecules using an ensemble of machine learning models. In parallel, Ivan has
maintained active collaborations with synthetic and forensic chemists and developed
new collaborations with international groups specializing in drug discovery and in
novel machine learning methodologies. His research outputs constitute open-source
cheminformatics libraries and tools, journal publications, monitoring programmes like
PharmaCrime and outreach community programmes such as DrugsInfoSite.</div>

          <div class="tab-content">Every virus present in nature has emerged from a common ancestral
family. For example, viruses such as Zika, chikungunya, coronaviruses, the dengue virus,
hepatitis viruses and more belong to a family of viruses called the Group-4 viruses. In my
project, I have identified common features, i.e., common binding sites, that are present in
related proteins among these viruses. The idea is to find a chemical entity, a potential
&quot;drug&quot;, that will bind to these similar binding sites. We have identified common binding
sites present in the helicase (nsp13) and Mac1 proteins (nsp3) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and
other Group-4 viruses. Since we have already identified bioactive hit compounds for the
Mac1 domain of nsp3, we envisage that these might also bind to the Mac1 domain of few of
the Group-4 viruses. The idea is to identify a common key (drug) for a common lock
(protein).</div>

Translational Medicine and Therapeutics at the University of Pennsylvania in 2019. Here he
investigated the effects of the COX-2 knockout gene on the phenotype of M1 pro-
inflammatory macrophages. He examined the morphological changes to the macrophage
cell membranes, using a cell culturing method that involved the extraction of mouse femur
bone marrow, and incubation with macrophage colony stimulation factor. Using analytical
techniques such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, he then processed the
supernatants and identified the molecular mass of the prostaglandins with indicators
attached to them. Finally he verified the lipopolysaccharide response in all cell cultures, and
analysed the results.
